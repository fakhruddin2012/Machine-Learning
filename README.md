##  Chapter 1: Introdution to Machine Learning.

---
We have seen Machine Learning as a buzzword for the past few years, the reason for this might be the high amount of data production by applications, the increase of computation power in the past few years and the development of better algorithms.

Machine Learning is used anywhere from automating mundane tasks to offering intelligent insights, industries in every sector try to benefit from it. You may already be using a device that utilizes it. For example, a wearable fitness tracker like Fitbit, or an intelligent home assistant like Google Home. But there are much more examples of ML in use.

Prediction — Machine learning can also be used in the prediction systems. Considering the loan example, to compute the probability of a fault, the system will need to classify the available data in groups.

Image recognition — Machine learning can be used for face detection in an image as well. There is a separate category for each person in a database of several people.

Speech Recognition — It is the translation of spoken words into the text. It is used in voice searches and more. Voice user interfaces include voice dialing, call routing, and appliance control. It can also be used a simple data entry and the preparation of structured documents.

Medical diagnoses — ML is trained to recognize cancerous tissues.

Financial industry and trading — companies use ML in fraud investigations and credit checks.
