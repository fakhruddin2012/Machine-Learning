## What is Machine Learning?

According to Arthur Samuel, Machine Learning algorithms enable the computers to learn from data, and even improve themselves, without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning (ML) is a category of an algorithm that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available.

## Types of Machine Learning?

Machine learning can be classified into 3 types of algorithms.

1.Supervised Learning

2.Unsupervised Learning

3.Reinforcement Learning
