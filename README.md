## What is Machine Learning?

According to Arthur Samuel, Machine Learning algorithms enable the computers to learn from data, and even improve themselves, without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning (ML) is a category of an algorithm that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available.

## Types of Machine Learning?

Machine learning can be classified into 3 types of algorithms.

1.Supervised Learning

2.Unsupervised Learning

3.Reinforcement Learning

## Overview of Supervised Learning Algorithm:

Supervised machine learning algorithms are designed to learn by example. The name “supervised” learning originates from the idea that training this type of algorithm is like having a teacher supervise the whole process.

When training a supervised learning algorithm, the training data will consist of inputs paired with the correct outputs. During training, the algorithm will search for patterns in the data that correlate with the desired outputs. After training, a supervised learning algorithm will take in new unseen inputs and will determine which label the new inputs will be classified as based on prior training data. The objective of a supervised learning model is to predict the correct label for newly presented input data.

Supervised learning can be split into two subcategories: Classification and regression.

## Overview of Unsupervised Learning Algorithm:

In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the system’s algorithms act on the data without prior training. The output is dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is one way of testing AI.
